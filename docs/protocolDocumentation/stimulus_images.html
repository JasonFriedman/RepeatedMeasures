The first column is the image number, the second the start time (frame number), the third the end time (frame number), and the fourth the amount of noise to add (0 for none). If there are 4 columns, the imageis displayed in the center of the screen. If there are 6 columns, the last two indicate the location (center of the image)</TD></TR>

Each trial starts in state 1. The image shown is equal to the state number (specified in stimuli).The times in stimuli are ignored if stateTransitions is non-empty (unless the start time is -Inf, in which case that image will be shown until the trial starts).</TD></TR>

Default is to use xy ([1 2]. The number of dimensions should match the number of dimensions of the targets as defined in targetPosition</TD></TR>
