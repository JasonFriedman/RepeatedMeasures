This response does not stop the trial, but shows feedback (similar to showPosition).<BR><BR>

Note that if showPosition=1, it will always be shown. If showPosition=2 and imagestimulus is used,it will only be shown when in state 1. If showPosition=3, then the fields below will be used to determine the position. If showPosition=4, it is the same as 3, but the position is only shown until the trial starts. If showPosition=5, it is the same as 3, but if using image stimuli, only show position if it is in state 1.If using a function, the function will get called every frame (data can be stored between calls in the thistrial struct): thistrial = yourFunctionName(experimentdata,thistrial,lastpositionVisual,e,frame);</TD></TR>
