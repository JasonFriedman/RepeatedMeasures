INSTALLING XMLTree
------------------

This toolbox requires MATLAB 5.3 or later and should work on all
platforms.

1) Extract the tar.gz file (you probably did this already):

> tar xvfz xmltree.tar.gz

or decompress the zip file:

> unzip xmltree.zip

2) Add the new path to Matlab (assuming you untared the toolbox
in '/home/flandin/matlab/'):

> addpath('/home/flandin/matlab/xmltree/');

The folder @xmltree doesn't need to be added in Matlab path, since 
it's a class folder. 

3) XMLTree package uses one mex-file for the parsing of XML data: 
this mex-file is provided for Windows, Linux and Solaris platforms.
If you need to compile it for your architecture, the command is:

> cd /home/flandin/matlab/@xmltree/private/
> mex -O xml_findstr.c

If never this compiled function doesn't work or behaves badly, 
comment the line #define __HACK_MXCHAR__ at the beginning of the 
file, and compile it again.

4) You can now launch demonstration mfiles:

> xmldemo1
> xmldemo2
> xmldemo3


If you've got troubles when installing this XML toolbox, you can 
send me an email (Guillaume.Flandin@sophia.inria.fr) explaining 
precisely your problem.
Suggestions for improvement and fixes are always welcome, although 
no guarantee is made whether and when they will be implemented.
